# FastSpeech2 Counterpart Implementation
This repository provides an implementation of FastSpeech2, a non-autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) model for high-quality and efficient speech synthesis.

Our implementation serves as a counterpart model for experiments and research based on the original [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558) paper.
